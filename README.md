# Qutrit
A simple library mimicking Qiskit to implement very basic Qutrit based circuits. Is constantly in the process of addition and refinement.

To use this library, the prerequisite modules which are to be installed already are:
- numpy
- qiskit
- sqtdiat
- seaborn

Steps to use:
- Download the "Qutrit.py" file and store it in the folder, where you open your Jupyter Notebooks.
- Then you can access the library by doing the following import:
  ```
from Qutrit import Qutrit
  ```
